Bangladesh’s embattled prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, fled the country on Aug. 5, 2024, after weeks of protests that have resulted in scores of deaths.

Her departure is a landmark moment, but one that has left the South Asian nation facing a power vacuum into which the army – for the time being, at least – has stepped.

To understand what led to the crisis and what could happen next, The Conversation turned to Tazreena Sajjad, an expert on Bangladeshi politics at American University’s School of International Service.

The protests stem from long-running resentment over a quota system that saw 56% of government positions in Bangladesh reserved for various groups, including 30% for the descendants of freedom fighters who fought in the 1971 War of Independence.

This quota system has proved an enormous barrier to highly coveted civil service positions for the country’s large youth population, many of whom are unemployed.

It had also become a subject of controversy due to how many of those quota jobs went to supporters of the ruling Awami League party.

Under immense pressure from an earlier student mobilization over the issue, Hasina abolished the entire quota system in 2018.

But in June 2024, the country’s high court ruled that move illegal, sparking a fresh round of protests across the country.

Then, in July, Bangladesh’s public universities saw a series of walkouts by faculty and students over new pension reforms that, if implemented, would involve salary deductions.

Initially, the protests were peaceful, but an incendiary speech by Hasina – in which she suggested that the students were “rajakaar,” a term used to identify pro-Pakistan collaborators during Bangladesh’s War of Independence – inflamed tensions.

The Bangladesh Chhatra League – the armed wing of the Awami League – began attacking students with tear gas and live bullets, with support from the police. The Rapid Action Battalion, a controversial paramilitary group with a history of extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances, was also deployed.

After a video of one of the first to be killed – a university student named Abu Sayeed – circulated online, more joined the protests, leading to a further violent crackdown by police and armed groups.

It is estimated that about 266 people, mostly students, were killed in the protests, including at least 32 children.

The government closed schools and universities, imposed a curfew and cut internet and telecommunications. Meanwhile, student leaders were arrested and coerced to withdraw their list of demands.

But this only led to the declaration of a total noncooperation movement and a massive uprising of protesters demanding Hasina’s immediate resignation.

As thousands of protesters gathered for a long march to Dhaka in defiance of the curfew, the prime minister resigned and left the country.

While attention has focused largely on the quota protests, a litany of grievances had piled up against the government.

Under Hasina’s rule, Bangladesh has seen GDP growth – but this has not translated into economic well-being for many Bangladeshis. Lack of opportunities, high unemployment rates among youth and soaring inflation have been ongoing sources of tension.

Meanwhile, despite the Awami League espousing a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption, money laundering, bribery and nepotism scandals have dogged government ministers.

And since its landslide victory in 2008, the Awami League has eroded the country’s democracy. For example, in 2011 the government ended an arrangement that allowed a 90-day caretaker administration, consisting of technocrats, to organize elections and oversee transfers of power.

Suppression of dissent has also grown. The harassment and detention of activists, opposition figures and human rights defenders have become more frequent. Meanwhile, there has been criminalization of any criticism of the government, including satire and social media posts.

Why is the 1971 war still relevant to Bangladeshi politics?

The War of Independence remains central to Bangladesh’s identity and its politics.

Its seeds were sown decades earlier in the 1947 British partition of the Indian subcontinent. This resulted in the violent division of the state of Bengal, with the eastern part becoming East Pakistan.

After partition, West Pakistan tried to maintain political and economic dominance over East Pakistan, while at the same time attempting to cultivate a singular national identity – based on their common Muslim majority populations – despite separate cultures and linguistic heritages.

Policies to marginalize Bengali – the vernacular of 56% of then East Pakistanis – and “purify” East Pakistan from Hindu influence contributed to a backlash that saw widespread student protests and growing calls for independence.

In 1971, a West Pakistani military incursion aimed at snuffing out pro-independence sentiments resulted in a genocidal war with East Pakistan that lasted nine months and resulted in the deaths of 500,000 to 3 million Bangladeshis.

The circumstances of that war have shaped Bangladesh’s politics ever since. The parties that have dominated the country’s politics, including Hasina’s Awami League, frequently politicized their War of Independence credentials. Political leaders have also used 1971 as a means of legitimizing positions, shoring up support, or delegitimizing opposition parties.

Does Hasina’s exit mark the end of Bangladesh’s political dynasties?

The resignation of Hasina signals – at least for the time being – the end of Awami League rule in Bangladesh.

Countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh, have largely been shaped by political dynasties. So the rejection of the Awami League, and the fact that many are also rejecting other established political parties – the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Jamaat-i-Islami and the Jatiya Party – is extraordinary.

These established parties will no doubt try to regroup. While the Awami League may not be able to effectively organize in the near future given public sentiment, the others will make a concerted effort to participate in the promised forthcoming elections.

For the moment, there may be an opportunity for Bangladesh to have fresh voices and faces in politics, potentially emerging from the student movement.
What should we make of the military taking interim control?

Since Bangladesh’s independence, the army has played a huge role in shaping the political trajectory of the country.

From 1975 to 2011, Bangladesh experienced at least 29 military coups and counter-coups. It also experienced direct military rule from 1977 to 1981 and between 1981 and 1990.

Given the army’s frequent incursion into Bangladesh politics, it is not surprising that it has taken interim control of the country now.

For many Bangladeshis, this may represent some level of stability, given the political vacuum that has opened up and the uncertainty of the moment.

Student leaders, however, have made it clear they do not want military involvement in politics. Seemingly heeding this call, General Waker-uz-Zaman, the army chief of staff, has assured protesters that the army would meet their demands.

But it remains to be seen whether the military will keep its promises and hand over full authority to a civilian interim administration.
What could happen next?

It is too early to speculate what the future holds for Bangladesh – the situation is extremely fluid and unfolding by the minute.

The abrupt departure of Hasina has been a cause of relief and celebration among the millions of protesters who helped bring about an end to her rule.

Protest leaders have expressed a clear vision for an inclusive, corruption-free, democratic government. What they don’t want is an interim government that is formed without their involvement and input. Student leaders have put together a list of candidates they want to see in the interim government. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has accepted a role as chief adviser. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-i-Islami leaders are vying for positions in the interim government.

But political transitions are extremely challenging and volatile. There have been incidences of looting, arson and violence around the country, as well as attacks on the Hindu community.

Armed wings of the Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami and the Bangladesh Chhatra League are being blamed for much of the violence, which, it is alleged, is carried out to delegitimize the protest movement. In response, students and the general public have stepped in to protect minority places of worship.

Rumors and disinformation campaigns will certainly have some significant impact in a volatile situation.

Meanwhile, the enormous damage done to the country’s economy by the political turmoil and military curfew will also require attention.

Neighboring countries, particularly India, are paying a lot of attention to the volatile situation. International donors and strategic partners including the U.S., EU, and China likewise await what comes next, given Bangladesh’s regional geopolitics and the global economy.

The political crisis in Bangladesh has intensified following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, leading to widespread unrest and a military coup. The army has established an interim government, heightening concerns about the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, and prompting India to bolster border security. This turmoil threatens India-Bangladesh trade relations, strategic interests, and regional stability. Amid this chaos, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to assume the role of head of the interim government today, August 8.

Military Coup in Bangladesh

    Event: Following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladesh Army intervened and staged a coup. The military cited the need to restore order and stability as their justification for seizing control.
    Consequences: The coup has led to the establishment of an interim government, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic processes and the potential for prolonged military rule.

Causes of Bangladesh Crisis

Bangladesh has been a crucial ally for India, fostering strong economic, social, and cultural ties. Under Sheikh Hasina’s leadership since 2009, the bilateral relationship flourished, with significant trade and security cooperation advancements. However, her sudden resignation has led to severe political turmoil and social unrest, threatening these achievements.
Who was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman?
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, often referred to as the “Father of the Nation” in Bangladesh, was a pivotal figure in the country’s history. He was the leader of the Awami League and played a crucial role in the struggle for Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971. Rahman served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as Prime Minister. His leadership and vision were instrumental in shaping the early years of the nation.
Background of Reservation Policy in Bangladesh

    Original Notification (1972): On September 5, 1972, a system reserving 30% of government and semi-government posts for freedom fighters, and 10% for women, was established.
    Post-Assassination Freeze: Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 1975, these quotas were frozen until 1996.
    Extension to Descendants: When Hasina became Prime Minister in 1996, benefits of the freedom fighters’ quota were extended to their children, and later to their grandchildren in 2011.
    Developments Post-2001: The implementation of the quota system slowed after the Awami League lost power in 2001 but picked up again when Hasina returned to power in 2009.
    2018 Withdrawal of Quota: In 2018, the Hasina government decided to scrap the freedom-fighter and other quotas, which was challenged in court.
        The High Court ruled the government’s decision was arbitrary, affirming that freedom fighters and their progeny were still considered backward.
    Supreme Court Decision: A temporary scaling down of the reservation on July 21 only momentarily calmed the protests, which soon resumed with increased intensity.
    Security Response: The government’s harsh crackdown resulted in over 100 deaths in just two days and around 300 in two months.

Political Background

    Election Credibility: Hasina’s Awami League won a third consecutive term in January, but the election’s credibility was marred by opposition boycotts and allegations of electoral fraud.
    Suppression of Opposition: The last decade of Hasina’s rule saw increased arrests of opposition leaders and crackdowns on dissent and free speech, intensifying in the past six months.
    Development Narrative: While Bangladesh remains one of South Asia’s fastest-growing economies, the development under Hasina has not met the aspirations of a demographic where over 60% are aged 15-65.
        Many businesses have not recovered from the COVID-19 crisis.
    Civil Unrest: The most severe civil unrest in two decades erupted over a controversial quota system for government jobs, reserved for descendants of freedom fighters. The unrest escalated from campus protests to nationwide violence.

Cultural and Ideological Divisions

    Secular vs. Muslim Nationalism: Bangladesh is deeply divided between secular nationalists and Muslim nationalists who did not support the 1971 liberation war.
        Hasina often used the Awami League’s role in the liberation as a political tool, exacerbating tensions.
    Authoritarian Rule: Hasina’s authoritarian tactics, including her denunciation of student protesters as “razakars,” have possibly paved the way for the resurgence of Islamist and pro-Pakistan sentiments in Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi Hindus in Danger?

The political instability in Bangladesh has raised significant concerns for the safety of its Hindu minority community. Amidst the turmoil following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation and the subsequent military coup, there are reports of targeted attacks on Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship.

Historical patterns suggest that political crises in Bangladesh often lead to increased violence against minorities, heightening fears for their safety. The international community and human rights organizations are calling for protective measures and support to ensure the safety and security of Bangladeshi Hindus during this period of unrest.
India’s Diplomatic and Strategic Response
Diplomatic Efforts

India is closely monitoring the situation. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has briefed an all-party delegation, ensuring a unified approach to the crisis. India is prepared to offer humanitarian assistance, including medical aid and supplies, to support Bangladesh during this challenging time.
Trade Adjustments

Indian exporters and businesses are making contingency plans to mitigate the impact of the crisis. The next few days will be critical in determining the extent of the disruption to trade and economic stability.
Challenges and Opportunities for India

    Standing by Allies: India’s credibility as a regional power hinges on its ability to support friends during crises. However, over-dependence on any single leader, like Hasina, poses risks if that leader’s domestic support wanes.
    Engaging the Opposition: With Hasina’s authoritarian drift and weakening legitimacy, India faces the immediate challenge of distancing itself from her while engaging constructively with her opponents.
    External Influences: The involvement of external players like Pakistan and China, who may try to steer the new Bangladeshi government away from India, is a major concern. Collaboration with Western allies and regional partners will be crucial to counter these influences and ensure a peaceful transition.

Future Outlook and Recommendations

    Maintaining Regional Stability: Beyond political manoeuvring, economic stabilisation and limiting extremism, with the help of Gulf partners like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, will be vital for maintaining regional stability.
    Diplomatic Stance: India should adopt a watchful but supportive approach to the unfolding situation, emphasising its respect for Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the democratic choices of its people.
    Maintaining Engagement: Drawing lessons from past experiences like in the Maldives, India should keep diplomatic channels open and continue to engage with Bangladesh’s new leaders to ensure ongoing cooperation and stability.
    1971 Liberation Narrative: India needs to reassess its emphasis on the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation narrative, which is divisive within Bangladesh.
        Engaging with all political forces without bias is necessary for fostering long-term mutual interests.
    Addressing Potential Hostilities: With potential shifts in policy from the new leaders in Dhaka.
        India must prepare to navigate possibly adversarial postures, similar to past experiences with other neighbouring countries during political transitions.... Read more at: https://www.studyiq.com/articles/bangladesh-crisis/


For several weeks in July, Bangladesh was wracked by its most serious episode of civil unrest in decades. What began as student protests against a controversial job quota system escalated into a nationwide crisis that has tapped into a deeper vein of discontent about the state of the economy, official corruption, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's heavy-handed crackdown. As of July 29, at least 150 people have died in the violence and 9,000 have been arrested.

The government’s response, which included a curfew and an internet blackout, has exposed a wider set of grievances and engendered another round of student demands, which the government seems completely disinclined to meet. There are now questions about the longer-term economic fallout of the unrest and whether political trust between the government and some segments of the population can be restored.
What triggered the protests?

The initial spark for the unrest was a High Court decision on a quota system for awarding government jobs. The system, created in 1972, the year after Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan, allocated 30 per cent of government positions to the descendants of “freedom fighters,” or those who fought on the side of liberation. Prime Minister Hasina is personally tied to the quota system: her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the country’s founding leader. 

That system remained in place until 2018, when widespread protests prompted the courts to abolish it. But on June 5 of this year, the High Court reversed that decision, clearing the way for the system’s reinstatement. Opposition parties and other critics have argued that such quotas unfairly benefit the descendants of pro-government supporters and are aimed at fostering loyalty within the bureaucracy and perpetuating the power of the ruling Awami League. The discontent is fuelled by a broader perception that there are limited opportunities for merit-based public sector jobs and a belief that some Bangladeshis game the system by obtaining fraudulent freedom fighter credentials.

On July 21, perhaps in part to quell the growing unrest, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court ruled that only five per cent of government jobs should be allocated for freedom fighters’ descendants. The protesters, however, were not placated. On July 22, Students Against Discrimination, the student group behind the protests, announced a 48-hour suspension of their demonstrations (which it subsequently extended another 48 hours) to allow the government to meet a new set of demands. These included a personal apology by Hasina for the protesters’ deaths; the arrest or resignation of law enforcement agents or government or university officials implicated in the crackdown; and compensation for the victims and their families.

On July 30, after Hasina ignored the students’ ultimatum, the students re-started their protests against the "mass killings, arrests, attacks, and disappearances of students and people.”
How did the government respond?

Hasina has labelled the protesters "Razakar" — collaborators with the enemy during the independence war — and has refused to engage with the movement’s leaders. Her party, the ruling Awami League, views these protests as agitation led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition party. 

Although the recent demonstrations began non-violently, things escalated after protesters were attacked by the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the ruling party's student wing, with sticks and steel pipes. By July 18, the government had deployed police and paramilitary forces across Dhaka to shut down campuses and disperse the protests. The government gave police shoot-on-sight orders for anyone violating the curfew, and subsequently shut down the internet and mobile data services, only partially restoring them in Dhaka and Chittagong on July 24. 

In the past, the Bangladeshi government has been accused of using similar internet shutdowns to suppress dissent, particularly during opposition-led protests. On July 30, the ruling Awami League-led coalition banned Jamaat-e-Islami, another opposition party, blaming it for inciting protests.
What are the broader frustrations fuelling these protests?

For years, Bangladesh’s economic story was a positive one. When it gained independence in 1971, Bangladesh was one of the world’s poorest countries. But around the year 2000, it began growing at an annual average rate of six per cent, reaching the important milestone of lower-middle income status in 2015. This growth has been primarily driven by the readymade garments industry, which employs 4.2 million workers. 

Nevertheless, several underlying issues have fuelled economic anxiety and frustration, such as inequality, youth unemployment, and high inflation. As of 2023, 40 per cent of youth aged 15–29 were classified as ‘NEET’ (not in employment, education, or training), with estimates that about 18 million young people are out of work. Economic hardships have been compounded by rising food inflation, which has reached 10 per cent, and increases in other living expenses. 

By mid-2023, more than 37 million of the country’s 172 million people faced moderate to severe food insecurity, and utility costs soared as the government raised electricity and gas prices three times within a single year. Reports of corruption among high-ranking officials and mismanagement have also eroded public trust, with the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population controlling 41 per cent of the nation’s income, while the bottom 10 per cent receive only 1.3 per cent.

What are the economic and foreign policy implications?

The ongoing unrest has exacerbated the economic strains bearing down on Bangladesh. Workers in the informal sector, which accounts for 85 per cent of the country’s workforce, are especially vulnerable to the effects of lockdowns and curfews. Additionally, lower-income and middle-class households have been severely impacted as prices of some essentials nearly doubled, increasing the financial strain on already struggling families.

The economic damage of the government’s response also extended beyond individual households. On July 22, Bangladesh’s business leaders urged Hasina to lift the curfew and restore internet services, which, according to the president of the Dhaka-based Foreign Investors’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has cost the Bangladeshi economy US$10 billion. Supply chain disruptions have reduced the availability of goods, leading to price hikes and increased inflationary pressures. The readymade garment sector, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of Bangladesh’s US$50 billion in export earnings, has been hit hard, and factories have remained closed since July 20, resulting in daily losses of nearly US$150 million. The internet blackout also severely impacted e-commerce and Facebook-based businesses, with daily revenue losses estimated at US$5 million.

The need to recover losses and repair damaged public infrastructure, combined with reduced export earnings, will put pressure on Bangladesh’s dwindling foreign exchange reserves. These economic pressures will complicate Hasina’s ongoing negotiations with the IMF and other countries for loans, especially given that S&P Global, an American financial analytics company, recently downgraded Bangladesh’s long-term sovereign rating from ‘BB-’ to ‘B+’ — indicating a high credit risk — due to the ongoing protests. On July 31, the EU, which is Bangladesh’s main trading partner, announced that it was delaying negotiations with Dhaka on a new economic pact that would have enhanced trade and other economic relations.

There have also been consequences for Bangladesh’s foreign relations. For years, Hasina has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights violations, which her government denies. In January, the Awami League won a fourth consecutive term, following a controversial election marred by a BNP boycott, violent protests, a crackdown on dissent, and low voter turnout. As a result, Hasina’s government came under heightened international scrutiny at the time by the U.S., U.K., the United Nations, and others.

In response to the recent violence, several nations, including Canada, Germany, and the U.S., have issued travel warnings for Bangladesh, and more than 4,500 Indians left due to safety concerns. Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and Defence Minister Bill Blair took to X to express concern about the violence, urging peace, condemning the attacks on protesters, and stressing the need for democratic freedoms and the rule of law.
Possible longer-term consequences

The recent crackdown could provoke a wider backlash against the government, spur an exodus of educated Bangladeshis, and loosen Hasina’s grip on power as trust between the state and citizens erodes. 

While student protests have focused on the Awami League’s favouritism towards war veterans' families, broader public discontent stems from the stifling political climate, a weakening economy, and the government's failure to address critical issues such as job scarcity and inflation. In recent months, there has been a surge in Bangladeshis seeking asylum in Canada, with projections of more than 5,000 asylum claims in Quebec alone and 22,000 in Canada as a whole by the end of 2024. 

The crisis in Bangladesh will place Western nations in an awkward position. But despite their concerns about human rights violations and democratic backsliding, Bangladesh's geopolitical importance and economic potential mean that Canada and other Western governments will likely take a cautious approach in their criticisms, balancing advocacy while maintaining crucial diplomatic and economic ties with a key South Asian partner.
